    "affordable_housing": "Roberts would propose changing how the city decides what constitutes “affordable” housing. Prices based on area median incomes are too costly for the average person, he says. Reserving affordable housing for people making no more than $50,000 per year would “provide opportunities for those not fortunate enough to have a high paying job such as those in the tech industry,” Roberts says.",
    "upzone_support": "Roberts says upzoning and development can be good but have recently been linked to displacement in communities such as Capitol Hill and Yesler Terrace. “I believe communities must be empowered with a vote to decide ‘yay’ or ‘nay’ on upzoning,” he says. Roberts says the Mandatory Housing Affordability uponzes plan should require more than seven percent of units in projects to be set aside as affordable.",
    "denser_housing": "Yes, Roberts supports the construction of mother-in-law units and more multi-family buildings in areas now zoned for single-family homes. But he says it’s important to respect the character of neighborhoods and the opinions of those who live there. Residents should be able to vote on zoning changes, he says.",
    "homeless_budget": "Roberts wouldn’t seek to increase the amount of money spent on homeless services, but he would “pledge to make every penny count.” He says the city should learn to do more with less “and find solutions within our means.” Solving homelessness requires more than money – it will take the cooperation and help of our all communities,” Roberts says.",
    "north_precinct": "I don’t have a problem with building a new North Precinct, providing that it can be done at a reasonable budget. Originally budgeted at $79 million, recent estimates have nearly doubled that cost. Arguably the original budget may have been unrealistic, but a fair compromise must be made in order to green light this project. ",
    "public_safety": "The opioid crisis is the largest public safety issue facing Seattle. It is important that we do not criminalize addiction, I believe in rehabilitation not incarceration. There are no free and low barrier detox facilities available in Seattle. It is currently infinitely less expensive to maintain a habit than seek treatment. Not only has this crisis run rampant in our homeless population, where it is most visible on our streets; but it affects our friends, families, and coworkers.\nThis is a Seattle voter’s problem and we are paying for it every time police and emt units are dispatched for an overdose. It’s time to put judgement aside and provide a path for recovery. \n",
    "congestion_strategy": "Seattle has painted itself into a corner with its transit issues. Commuting issues have been compounded by the housing crisis that forces people to move further away from their jobs.  The efforts to make Seattle more bike friendly, while commendable, have also contributed to down town congestion.  Seattle has long been known for its war on cars, which in my opinion is the most detrimental to those who can least afford it; low income workers. At this late stage in the game I would not make it harder to commute by car, but would focus my efforts on improving mass transit, optimizing high traffic areas, and pushing the ST3 schedule forward. ",
    "taxation_strategy": "I would prefer a state income tax and removing sales tax. I do not support the city “tax on the rich”. Tax should be fair and proportionate, not punitive.",
    "wage_gap": "I believe the same work deserves the same pay. Women and men preforming the same job should be compensated equally. ",
    "waterfront_strategy": "I support the idea of a vibrant waterfront park, the current plans truly sound amazing. Things to consider are the $420 million estimated cost and the fact that that area is an important rout for freight and traffic. My plan would likely be a hybrid that focused on maximizing traffic, ensuring pedestrian and bike safety, and controlling costs as well as park improvements. To ease the burden on the tax payer privatizing some of the park projects could be an option. ",
    "misc": "I want to bring transparency and accountability to the mayor’s office. I will work within the bounds of our city budget to deliver the results that have eluded city government thus far. I believe that neighborhoods and communities should have a seat at the table and a vote concerning issues that affect them. Small business has taken a back seat to massive growth and development, I intend to bring the balance back. There can be prosperity without sacrificing our identity, we can cherish the old and embrace the new. "

    "taxation_strategy": "I am proposing an Employee Head Tax, on large companies (over 1500 employees) in the Seattle area. This tax, paid by the employer, would create a sliding scale tax starting at 1% at employees making over $82k a year and progress to 3% at the top level of $150k(there would be no cap on income tax). Again, this tax would be paid by the employer and is the best way to get actual progressive tax change to Seattle without having to deal with WA state until the state senate comes to their senses in regards to taxes.",
    "wage_gap": "I would promote all public businesses located in the Seattle area to have an open salary policy, where everyone within the company(not outside) can know how much everyone makes. I would also address wage gap complaints as a whistleblower protected status.",

Although I do not agree with it, the tunnel is almost dug and we cannot have decent planning and road construction if plans are changing all the time. I would be in favor of tolling the tunnel as it will merely be a by-way and adds nothing to the city of Seattle.",

The meritocratic and liberal attacks directed at Trump are actually aimed at the working class as a whole.  My campaign speaks out against liberal intolerance of debate, a preoccupation with identity politics and political correctness instead of debate to come to class clarity and a working class road to taking political power out of the hands of the capitalist class.\nTo end the racism and dog eat dog competition of the two party capitalist system will require building a movement capable of overturning capitalism in a successful workers' revolution like the one made by the Cuban people in 1959,  which stands strong today.

    "congestion_strategy": "More difficult?  Could it possibly be more difficult?  No, I would do all in my power to ease traffic flow. It would start by dismissing the current Transportation Director and replacing him with someone who has experience with resolving problems for four-wheeled vehicles rather than bicycles. \n\nI would spend dollars on synchronizing lights, re-evaluating the Mercer mess, consider different routes for bikes to free up lanes on arterials, put a halt to trolley expansion, and utilize more 21st century technology to address the issue. Although restructuring the finances of the city is my first priority, I would act in the greatest haste and with a profound sense of urgency to attack this problem immediately.\n",
    "taxation_strategy": "First of all, I would be very surprised and disappointed if I couldn’t get through four years without proposing a tax increase. Seattle is awash in more tax revenue than ever before and still City Hall has their hand out asking for more. \n\nI would look to roll back some taxes on businesses and examine which taxes are meeting their sunset dates and look to discontinue those. I don’t believe an income tax is a viable option (since it is not allowed by the state) and although sales tax is regressive, I do believe that a more modest sales tax is fair and appropriate. With other programs in place (i.e. – City light subsidies for low income families, etc.) I think we are doing a fairly good job of evening the playing field for everyone.\n",
    "wage_gap": "As a mayor who has a lifetime of business experience, I am looking forward to building a good relationship within the business community in Seattle. I would work with the larger companies to gain more self-regulation and transparency concerning the gender wage gap. As a strong believer in the free enterprise system, I do not think it is necessarily city government’s role to do what the federal government is failing to adequately do. Hopefully, there will be some changes on a national level that address this issue more forcefully.",
    "waterfront_strategy": "This is clearly a most important issue, particularly since the decisions made over the next few years will impact the city for decades to come. I would want to dissect the existing plan and determine where funds are needed, discuss that with the State since 99 is a State Highway, and present a modestly different plan that more effectively addresses pedestrian safety, open spaces, future infrastructure requirements, and transportation in and around the area. I believe that many good ideas will come from various directions as the viaduct comes down and we see for ourselves what we really have to work with. Including the businesses on the waterfront in that decision-making process is a must.\n\n",
    "misc": "I have spent my life managing small and medium-sized businesses, growing them through cautious spending and careful cash flow management. In the process, I’ve learned a great deal about working with and through people to build an effective organization in multiple industries – and the rules for doing that are transferable and applicable to any organization. \n\nI believe that my financial background and my understanding of how to build win-win relationships with employees, vendors, and customers will serve me well in the mayor’s office. I am also confident that the abilities I have nurtured which allow me to rapidly get to the core of problems and then attack that core to solve the issues I face, will help me to look at the challenges facing the city in a way that few mayors have. I am a no-frills, back to basics type person and I think that is what our city needs right now. \n\n"

We need a new facility there, but the scope of that project and pricetag inexplicably ballooned out of control after the early concept for a simpler project was developed in collaboration with the community. We need to go back to that point and aim for a simpler, more modest facility, without the big increase in parking capacity, that serves the needs of the police precinct. ",
    "public_safety": "The most important challenge is ensuring that our emergency responders have the resources and staff needed to do their jobs effectively and safely. \n \nSeattle has been experiencing an uptick in shootings likely related to gang violence, which puts first responders and police in riskier situations. Because of defunding of mental and behavioral health services, additional burdens have been placed on police and first responders to deal with individuals in crisis. Because of the nation’s opioid epidemic, first responders and police have additional workload. All these additional demands stretch thin the staffing, and require additional skills and training.  \n \nAnother key priority is negotiating legislation and continuing ongoing racial equity training  to reform our police department and bring our city into compliance with the federal consent decree.\n",
    "congestion_strategy": "A lack of transit options forces workers to drive, which only compounds congestion. We need to add more bus service hours and bus-only lanes because when transit is fast, convenient, and reliable, people will use it. We need to use the tools we have to incentivise transit use by employees and students, via employers and institutions. All the good work being done by Commute Seattle to encourage all the alternatives to drive alone (biking, car pools and other Transportation Demand Management options) should be expanded to scale to other neighborhoods, institutions and employers. We need to prioritize the basic bike network; making biking safer will attract more users.  We need to continue the Transportation Benefit District levy that adds service hours in Seattle, and continue to find opportunities to get Metro to add more service in densifying neighborhoods.",
    "taxation_strategy": "We need to reverse our regressive tax structure by holding the wealthiest among us accountable to pay their fair share. I support a progressive higher earners income tax, especially if coupled with a decrease in sales taxes -- but it’s only one of many solutions needed. An income tax may take years to run through the legal system, so we need other solutions in motion, too.\nI propose these solutions to make our tax structure more progressive and sustainable long term:\n \nInstitute an additional REET on luxury real estate, and a tax on corporate and non-resident ownership to deter speculation.\nImplement a capital gains tax statewide on high-income households, to tax wealth from unearned income, not just wages.\nWorking with Olympia, close tax loopholes providing no public benefit and making it harder for small, local businesses to compete.\nExplore making the B&O tax more steeply progressive with size of business.\n",
    "wage_gap": "Employers -- public sector and private sector -- beyond a certain size should be required to publicly disclose pay rates across age, race, performance review scores, and gender. Seeing the problem in its full breadth and scale is essential to targeting solutions within the workplace. Many tech companies in Silicon Valley have used this analysis as their first step to catalyze new approaches and new standards for hiring and promoting to achieve gender pay equity. \n\nAs mayor, I would work to expand our family leave policy to the private sector as well, using a model like unemployment insurance where all employers and employees pay into a shared fund and employees may access the benefit as needed. A society that values women equally must remove the obstacles in the path to success for women.\n",

    "denser_housing": "Durkan says growth “requires that every part of the city increase density.” But he says Seattle shouldn’t take a “one-size-fits-all approach” across neighborhoods.

But Durkan believes additional resources may be needed for mental-health and addictions services and for permanent housing, given the scope of the problem.",
    "north_precinct": "Yes, but not as it is currently designed and budgeted. The existing police precinct for North Seattle does not meet the needs of the police department or the community it is supposed to serve. It is grossly overcrowded by 65%. As a result, detectives and other staff are housed in nearby commercial office space, which adds to costs and hinders effective communication, efficiency, and cohesiveness. This in turn impacts their effectiveness within our communities, and is an inefficient use of taxpayer dollars.\n\nWith a $160 million price tag, people are right to raise questions. We have made upgrades in other police precincts for about one-fifth the proposed cost of this project. I believe there are changes we can make that can reduce the cost of the facility while preserving its core functions. This is the type of oversight and analysis I would be doing on all major projects as mayor.\n",
    "public_safety": "Our police reform efforts have taken hold and are a national model. Our fire and emergency medical services are second to none. But we must continue to invest resources to ensure we are building today what we need for tomorrow. Police reform remains a top priority. We need to cement gains, so we can see the end of court oversight. \n\nBut effective public safety goes beyond policing. Our city’s approach to people in crisis and suffering from mental health challenges and drug addiction - including one of our greatest public safety issues, the opioid epidemic - will determine how well we address issues like homelessness, neighborhood livability, and property crime. We need an “all tools” approach: including intensive educational and treatment programs. Without meaningful mental health and addiction programs, we will not be able to address the increasing demand for emergency medical services, especially among our homeless and elderly populations.\n",
    "congestion_strategy": "I strongly support getting Sound Transit light rail and express bus services built and operational as quickly and responsibly as possible. While the passage of ST3 last year was a huge step, we need to work together on the promised light rail expansions. We must collaborate with Sound Transit to identify opportunities to expedite the planning, design, and delivery of these essential mass transit services while ensuring extensive and integral community involvement in the process.\n\nWe must ensure our investments in bus service at the city are contributing to a more equitable city. This is particularly important for working families who are hit disproportionately by the increasing cost of transportation.\n\nWe need to consider a 24/7 transit system to make using transit easier and more convenient at all hours of the night. I also plan to explore making bus fare free for all young people under 18 years old.  \n",
    "taxation_strategy": "First, we need to keep our promises to Seattle residents, businesses, and voters —  to ensure the taxes they have paid are used wisely and efficiently. Before supporting or seeking any tax increases, I would take steps to ensure accountability for the collection and expenditure of current revenues.\n\nI’m also concerned about property taxes in the city. With rising property values, many can’t afford their rising property tax bills. I will work with legislators to increase the exemption for seniors in the city and see if there are ways to provide property tax relief to lower income individuals and to landlords that provide affordable housing.\n\nI would also like to explore how we can reform our regressive tax system in favor of more progressive options. I supported the statewide income tax when it was on the ballot, and would continue to encourage state lawmakers to adopt a more progressive tax system. \n",
    "wage_gap": "Both the City of Seattle and private businesses should adopt equal pay for equal work and hold employers accountable. I will work with our business community as well as employee organizations to finally address this problem.",
    "waterfront_strategy": "With the removal of the Alaskan Way Viaduct, we have a historic opportunity to reconnect the city with its waterfront.  I have been talking to a variety of people about this historic opportunity.  We need to “go big” – as it will help define what Seattle is for generations to come.  This means building and maintaining the bikeways, sidewalks, and the street as well as designing the space to make it fun, safe, and welcoming for residents and visitors.\n\nI believe that a combination of private philanthropy and other sources, will allow us to raise the revenues we need to create a vibrant, publicly accessible waterfront that Seattleites will use and cherish for generations to come.  Funding might include a downtown “Local Improvement District” – fees paid by property owners (commercial and residential) who will benefit (increased property values, increased tourism) from being near the new park.\n",

Until President Barack Obama nominated me in 2009, no openly gay person had ever served as US Attorney in the 200 plus years of history. I was honored and proud to break that barrier. And it is no surprise that it happened in Seattle. We are a city that leads.\n\nIf elected, I would be the first-ever lesbian to serve as mayor and the first woman in 100 years. Our city faces real challenges. No one, including me, has all of the answers. Our town usually doesn’t lack ideas or rhetoric, but we will need leadership to get past the noise, to bring people together, and to get things done. That is the kind of mayor I will be.

In particular I would look at excessive growth in management - for example the Mayor’s office grew by 80% over three years. It would be premature to say now which department I would prioritize first for a budget reduction without first conducting a careful review of the City’s current budget situation at the departmental level.",

The existing North Precinct facility has deficiencies that warrant review, but the price of the proposed new building is way out of control. I would restart the analysis of how to meet the facility needs for SPD in the North Precinct.\nIt’s a sign of how the budgeting of the current administration has become disconnected from the people of this city.  At the same time as the city is considering building the most expensive precinct in the nation, the city is looking at privatizing Green Lake Community Center, and claiming we do not have sufficient funds to maintain community centers across the city.\n",
    "public_safety": "We have a number of public safety issues. As examples, shots fired in Seattle continues to rise. Reported domestic violence assaults are increasing, as is reported violent crime overall.  Sixty-nine unsheltered people died in King County last year, many of which could have been avoided with basic shelter and health care.  Approximately twenty people die each year in our city due to traffic collisions.\n \nMy approach is that every department has to make public safety a priority. For crime-fighting it would be a multi-faceted approach, with a focus on building partnerships with the community to fight crime. We also must invest in youth violence prevention and alternatives to gangs for young people. For homelessness it will be providing shelter.  On traffic safety it will involve continuously improving our streets to reduce the likelihood and severity of collisions. \n",
    "congestion_strategy": "We should always work to make it easier for people to get around, regardless of how they travel.  The challenge is that job and population growth is overwhelming our streets, and we are way behind on transit improvements. We need to make better use of our existing street grid - light synchronization and a smart system can help, but we also must improve our transit, pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure. We need to make our buses, rail transit, bicycle network and pedestrian infrastructure work as a holistic and safe system for all so that everyone can get where they want to go safely.

Because our local tax system is regressive, that means unnecessary spending is by definition regressive. \nTo the extent we need more revenue for major new initiatives, I support progressive tax and/or fee policies. I support a high-earner’s income tax. When levies come up for renewal that we must renew I will also look at funding packages that include progressive sources.\nIn particular for new initiatives I believe we need to look at increasing taxes on our large successful corporations, while also reducing the burden on small businesses by increasing the exemption level of the business and occupation tax.\n",

In the last budget I submitted we included a reserve to be used to raise wages for underpaid women. If elected I would return to that work.\n \nWe also must recognize that the gap often occurs because occupations traditionally occupied by women are undervalued, for example, childcare, domestic work, and administrative positions. The city can play a role in supporting better pay and benefits for such workers in the private sector, especially companies we contract with. At the very least we should collect data from such companies as a starting point to addressing the gender wage gap. Expanding paid family and medical leave will also make it easier for women in the workforce, who often are set back economically in dealing with family and medical issues.\n",

The State has the obligation to pay for taking down the viaduct and building the new surface road, although the state has been cutting that budget to pay for cost overruns on the tunnel.\n \nI am concerned that portions of the waterfront  design are overly extravagant. We need to look at reducing overall project costs to ensure that the project does not soak up tax revenues that could be used to maintain existing facilities city-wide. \n \nI am committed to funding the city’s agreed upon portion, and holding the State to its promised funding. Local property owners benefiting from the improvements can help pay through a local improvement district. \n",

As Mayor I enforced the rule against camping in parks and would so again, after ensuring every person has a safe place to go. \n \nClosing:\n Seattle is a great place because of the people who live here. At some point in the past few years I think that’s gotten lost in our city’s decision-making. I want to be Seattle’s mayor so that I can help be your voice when it comes to taking progressive action when it matters. I learned a lot when I had the honor of serving this great city as mayor and I would be humbled to once again have that opportunity.\n"

In order for us to have safer neighborhoods and healthier city we must get ahead of the housing crisis and assist neighborhoods in restabilizing. One of the most damaging effects of gentrification, is what it does to community relationships. Residents who have lived in their homes for years may have the police called on them or their children or their relatives because of implicit bias. As a result, our neighborhoods become places where we are all less safe and are  more likely to have negative encounters with each other and police especially if we are low-income or black/brown. Furthermore, destabilized neighborhoods contribute to the state of emergency around homelessness as people are displaced and pushed out of their homes without any other options.

Now, we have a community that's organized and full of strength, ready to take leadership and achieve self-determination. We may have never witnessed or experienced the mayor we deserve, but we have a chance to give the most powerful seat in Seattle to the People. We deserve better - and the only ones that can make it better are the people who have experienced first hand how this city and system has failed them.\n\nI, personally, am answering the call from community to run for mayor. This is not a decision I made on my own. I am at the service of the community, and it is an honor to run side by side with them. I am running for Mayor with the Seattle Peoples Party to continue our pursuit of equity for all—and particularly for Seattle’s youth and marginalized communities.\n\nI have never personally set out to be a politician or an elected. However, I have always set out to serve community and the interests of the most disenfranchised in our communities. Seattle is facing an existential crisis, “Who has the right to stay here?” As the city becomes less affordable, fewer and fewer of the people who keep our city functioning can afford to live here—including our educators and city workers. If we do not make some key changes in the next few years our city will grow wealthier and more homogenous. I believe that Seattle wants to be a progressive, affordable, and diverse city; and therein a healthier city for all."

    "upzone_support": "Harris says aspects of the Mandatory Housing Affordability upzones plan give him pause. “Like many residents, I simply do not trust our current city leadership to make responsible, effective decisions on how to spend our money,” he says. Harris says he would pursue partnerships with developers in order ot build and finance long-term affordable housing. He says he’s intrigued by the idea of a municipal bank.",
    "denser_housing": "Harris would allow more density in zones now reserved for single-family homes, in the form of mother-in-law units. He says such units can save older homes that “make up the fabric” of Seattle neighborhoods. He says the city should allow mother-in-law units in non-owner-occupied structures. Harris would consider easing restrictions on backyard cottages.",
    "homeless_budget": "“It’s not how much we spend, but how we spend it,” Harris says. “Seattle spends more on its homelessness epidemic than almost any other city,” he says. Rather than raise more money “to throw at the problem,” the city should eliminate wasteful programs, its highly-paid homelessness czar position and “wet houses” and should redirect funds to “dignity for a day” programs and tiny houses, Harris says.",

And I do not join others in their assertion that the costs of the project are ballooning out of control and that the total budget exceeds any other similar project in the U.S.  First of all, it doesn't.  Second, it's too difficult to compare projects from other regions. My understanding is that the cost of the NP station is close to that of the South Precinct Station.  Let's get it built. Let's continue to give the best Police Department in the country all the tools they need to protect and serve us. ",
    "public_safety": "Homelessness. See above. And of course climate change. As Mayor, I pledge to add Seattle to the list of 27 other cities committed to going to 100% renewable energy by 2035.

    "congestion_strategy": "Strategic up zoning in neighborhoods with better access to public transit,  facilitating more accessory dwelling units (ADUs), residential development in SoDo, and STOP THE WAR ON CARS! We need an all-of-the-above approach to relieving congestion, and that includes the reality that families in Seattle (like mine) can't always use mass transportation to get around. As we build light rail and improve bus service, we also need to build and maintain infrastructure for vehicles, and not continue our present culture of making drivers as miserable as possible in hopes they'll get out of their cars.  I also believe, personally, that the city has too often enabled cyclists and pedestrians, pitting residents against residents, and has been too quick to issue permits for demonstrations and other private fundraising events that clog our city streets.",
    "taxation_strategy": "No new taxes.  Reform of the B&O tax, which hurts businesses large and small. Repeal of the (I believe illegal) \"Wealth Tax\" and the jobs-killing, low-yielding regressive soda tax.  No increase in the regressive sales tax, which is one of the highest of any city in the U.S.  Stop targeting Amazon and other corporate residents -- stop biting the hands that are feeding us this extraordinary and enduring boom, and increasingly helping Seattle address other pressing issues in the city like homelessness. Press Olympia and stand with Republican legislators who are fighting to revise the car tabs fee from ST3. And if we truly want to address fairness in taxation, take it to the State level and advocate that Washington adopt an income tax while repealing the sales tax. Let our State be that beacon to the rest of the country on this issue, rather than going it alone in our city.  We simply need to do better with what we have.   ",
    "wage_gap": "Our country has made enormous progressive on closing the wage gap in the last several decades -- women in the '60s were getting about 60 cents to a dollar for men; today that's closer to 80 cents.  But that's still not acceptable.  That gap is two-and-a-half times higher than any other developed country on the planet. The Obama administration made great strides in addressing this -- but still not enough. Seattle can be a beacon for other cities by adopting a model similar to California's Fair Pay Act, which goes beyond just reporting requirements for companies but has additional protection including that women don't need to have the same job title in order to have a claim of doing equal work. And importantly,  protecting them from retribution if they dare to raise the question of fair pay. This seems like a progressive/liberal idea, but I believe it's pro-business. A stronger city policy on equal pay will help attract the kind of talent that has fueled this economic boom in Seattle. ",
    "waterfront_strategy": "Unlike some of my opponents like Mike McGinn and Cary Moon, I have been a strong supporter in past of replacing the dangerous, crumbling Viaduct with a tunnel and rebuilding our sea wall (as an environmental advocate fighting climate change in a port city); however, we know the tunnel will only accommodate a small portion of the traffic the Viaduct does. It won't solve our traffic problem but make it worse, so we have to mitigate, even little by little.  We simply cannot close off the waterfront to cars that need to get from one side of the city to another, as some of the other candidates want to do.  The waterfront belongs to all of us, not non-profits who envision a no-cars Seattle, where presumably we all get around in personal jet packs. We need to review the existing plan, and consider any changes to it that have informed us in the several years since we penciled out a post-Viaduct plan. And yes, that includes cars.   ",
    "misc": "I'm a single father of two kids in public school, with a big stake in the future of our city -- and a big concern about the direction its leadership has tilted in the last several years. We need to right this ship.  Some 30% our of residents now have come here in the last five years -- this is a new, global city, and yet our politics are increasingly provincial and, often, parlor socialist.  In listing to the left, we have left a lot of good ideas in our wake -- 28% of our registered voters are Republican, and a large chunk are moderate who believe in addressing our social and environmental issues in a progressive way, but reject the excessive tax burdens our elected officials continue to heap on our residents and businesses. My experience as an 11-time Emmy Award-winning documentarian and 15-year veteran producer and photojournalist for ABC News have taught me three important things that will inform my approach as Mayor -- get in there, talk to people on the scene, don't go in with the story written.  That's the same experience I've had in my five years as Executive Director of the Pacific Whale Watch Association, an industry that I led that contributes about $200/year in economic impact to the region -- and is comprised of owners of all political persuasions.  I'm credited with turning that industry around and making it profitable and a world paradigm for sustainable wildlife viewing. I AM FROM THE \"RADICAL CENTER,\" as I say, a \"Pro-Business Progressive.\"  A moderate.  At times in this election, a vegetarian at a BBQ.  But I believe I speak to a majority of voters who have been left out of this discussion about the future of the city.  In this overly crowded race for Mayor, we've had some trouble getting the same media as establishment Democrats, but we're beginning to get noticed. We have endorsements from the former Commander of Navy Region Northwest, Clipper Navigation Inc. (Victoria Clipper and the Tall family), Rock and Roll Hall of Famers and Seattle treasures Ann and Nancy Wilson from Heart, and even anticipate an endorsement from GM Nameplate, the largest manufacturer in Seattle -- and a conservative family.  I may not have the exposure and name recognition of others in this race -- but why do we keep hiring attorneys to run this city?  We need leaders, not another lawyer.  And we don't need failed activists or transplants from Washington's do-nothing congress.  We need a fresh approach, someone who's proven he has the courage, conviction, communication skills and unique experience to put Seattle on a better course. Together, let's right this ship!  "

Along with developers and tech workers, police are unjustly vilified.  If they were to focus on only violence and theft, respect for police would increase.  We ask them to do too much, and the traffic – caused by, as always, disastrous central planning – is another hurdle that police must negotiate when driving to North Seattle.",
    "public_safety": "See above.  Shootings, including gang violence, is the most important public-safety challenge facing Seattle.

By taxing only the land, not what is on it, denser (greener) growth is incentivized, and those with shared walls will have cheaper rent/taxes (houses vs. apartments and condos).

Strategically, I think we are better served with the smaller precinct houses.  I would also keep an eye on scope creep and other unnecessary costs.

We need to recognize that we need to rapidly expand detox and rehab services.   In addition, we need to start prosecuting high-level drug dealers.  We should limit OxyContin prescriptions to a 5 - 7 day supply for non-chronic illnesses.  We need to work with the state to require insurance companies to cover detox and rehab services.  We should consider converting some jail and prison spaces to detox and rehab facilities.  Once Fentanyl moves into the area, we will lose thousands of citizens to overdose.  We must act boldly and with urgency.",
    "congestion_strategy": "It is.  We need \"Smart Traffic Lights\" throughout the city.  We need to reassess which bike lanes are being used and remove the ones not being used.  We should require parking spaces for new buildings.  We need to remove \"pinch points\" and \"road diets\" until after ST3 is fully implemented.  We should also consider a high-speed gondola system like Chicago, New York, Miami, and Austin are considering.  We can only fit so many cars, trains, light-rails cars, buses, and trucks on the same road.  The Gondola system costs 1/20 of what light rail costs and can move 800% more people/hour.",
    "taxation_strategy": "Seattle is one of the most wasteful cities in America.  It has no cost control mechanisms, poorly written contracts, no real-time budgetary systems, and does not leverage technology to drive down costs.  I would implement a six sigma/lean practices, a technology team, and an audit team tasked with upgrading our city to 2017 technologies and operating efficiency to drive down costs and eliminate waste.  I would then seek to eliminate regressive taxes.  Seattle's budget grew $1.6 billion dollars, 37% in 4 years.  This equals $2370.37 for every citizen of Seattle.  We must realize the City of Seattle is one of the major drivers of unaffordability here in Seattle.",
    "wage_gap": "We can do this through educating both our students and businesses about the gender wage disparities and how best to overcome them.  We can lead by example by eliminating gender wage disparities throughout Seattle City Government.  We can also conduct surveys of local businesses to access the magnitude of gender wage disparities and publish the findings.  We can then make women aware about the pay rates for jobs they might seek and how best to negotiate compensation.",

I have creative ideas to speed up the process, including streamlining permitting, as was done for the highway projects in the 2015 transportation package, and working with the state to make Sound Transit eligible for state funding again. Second, we need to transform our pedestrian and bike infrastructure into a safer, more extensive, and truly interconnected network. I support investments in sidewalks, pedestrian and bike paths like the Burke-Gilman Trail, clearly marked bike lanes on neighborhood streets, and planning efforts that help communities identify and prioritize bike infrastructure. I’ve devoted my entire career to equitable transit and transportation policy, and it’s the reason I ran for office after my service as Executive Director of Transportation Choices Coalition.

    "wage_gap": "The key driver of the gender wage gap is access to affordable child care. I plan to ensure that, by 2020, no family in Seattle will have to pay more than 10 percent of their income no child care. The first step in the three-part plan is a “Child First” approach to providing affordable childcare and early learning, which focuses on kids rather than the entities that serve them. The city would provide a one-stop clearinghouse for the numerous services and organizations that help parents afford child care and early learning. This coordinated effort will help focus successful federal programs like Head Start with State, County, and existing City resources. By pulling all resources and entities together under one roof, Seattle can consolidate and coordinate funds to more efficiently serve families in need. Second, the plan builds a greater partnership between the City, child care providers, and private employers, encouraging them to provide better coverage or contribute to the City’s effort to provide more opportunities. Organizations like United Way of King County and Thrive Washington as potential partners in this endeavor, as well as the support that partners like SEIU 925 can bring by helping deliver better training, housing, and economic justice for providers. I also propose an increase in the Families and Education Levy in 2018. The Levy invests millions in health care and early learning for Seattle’s children, setting them on the right path for a lifetime of academic achievement. Increasing this levy will expand the reach of the City’s program to more families, bringing greater funding resources to Seattle’s one-stop clearinghouse for parents.",
    "waterfront_strategy": "We should continue with the plan we have committed to that the Office of the Waterfront is working toward making reality. It is key to us as a city and to the whole region to have a vibrant and diverse waterfront that is open to pedestrians. We need to make sure that the State gets behind the project fully, and I will bring my experience working in Olympia to that partnership.",
    "misc": "I am the environmental candidate in this race. Seattle has not had a truly effective, progressive, environmental Mayor in our history who has placed this as a very top priority in our city’s development and growth. This has motivated me throughout my career, and the opportunity to lead in Seattle on a bold environmental, low carbon, smart growth agenda, is an area of overwhelming opportunity for our City at a time when we’re seeing federal retrenchment. The transition to a low carbon economy will be the greatest opportunity for equitable growth in the 21st century. Seattle, because of our natural reliance on a low carbon grid, and our progressive values, can and should lead by example for the country."

    "affordable_housing": "Hasegawa would set up a municipal bank to finance the construction of more housing. He says Singapore and Berlin have done that. Hasegawa attributes displacement in Seattle to policies not considering impacts on current residents. The situation reminds him of the 1970s, when “urban renewal” policies led to “urban removal … as powerless people were driven out of their homes,” Hasegawa says.",
    "upzone_support": "Hasegawa says some areas and some lots can accommodate greater density, such as large lots in North Seattle. He says high-density living “does not degrade the quality of life if it is well done.”",
    "denser_housing": "“In some areas and on some lots,” neighborhoods could accommodate greater density, Hasegawa says. “Some of the large lots in the north end, for example, could easily accommodate denser populations,” he says. Generally, Hasegawa is “not in favor of upzoning for higher density in single-family neighborhoods.” He says downtown neighborhoods can easily accommodate 30-story buildings “for upscale tech workers.”",
    "homeless_budget": "Hasegawa says the city should use the $60 million “to capitalize a municipal bank and then bond against it to finance services for the homeless. Services for the homeless should include “pre-employment” assistance, he says. “Simply providing housing without the services is pouring money down the hole,” Hasegawa says. “Our intention must be to successfully reintegrate homeless people back into society.”",
    "north_precinct": "We have so many unmet social needs that could be filled with that money that Seattle can wait for the new police station. Some will say that the people can vote in a new property tax to do what they would like to see happen, and that is true. But there are many, many residents who simply cannot pay more. They have not yet recovered from the Great Recession, if they ever will. Instead of introducing more regressive taxes, let's use the money that we have to fund services that help keep people out of jail in the first place.",
    "public_safety": "I am inclined to think that homelessness is one of the most important public-safety challenge facing Seattle. The people who are living without shelter are in extremely vulnerable situations. We have car prowlers and other property crimes. But when I think of “public-safety” challenges instead of “criminal activity” challenges, I am immediately brought to disaster resilience issues such as surviving the earthquake we all know is coming. Or major climate change destructive weather issues that impact all of us, not just the victim of either a single person on person or person on property crime. I know of no one who is fully prepared for this type of disaster. We try to do “Blue Cascade” trial runs to see how we could cope and the results are not encouraging.",
    "congestion_strategy": "Busses and van pools are the way to address congestion, both before 2021 and after. Several years ago a proposal was submitted to Sound Transit called Ride Free Express.  It was based on two aspects of transit ridership that are ignored by agencies committed to building rail projects:  transit fares matter -- as with most things, pricing matters a lot. Ride Free Express could eliminate all transit and vanpool fares, increase commute-time bus service and fund additional vanpools to serve the employment centers. The total 20-year cost in today’s dollars for Ride Free Express was less than $4.5 billion.  It would attract a minimum of 193,000 new daily riders. As  mayor I would put this proposal on the front burner.  It should be noted that Whidbey Island Transit is FREE to ride.  If they can do it, the City of Seattle should at least look into it.",
    "taxation_strategy": "I am on record as favoring a personal and business progressive income tax. I believe we need to pursue a comprehensive revenue reform strategy with multiple components to make our system less regressive, with adequate resources to provide services we all expect in a civilized society.  So besides a progressive income tax on wealthy households, we need to eliminate the B &U  tax and convert it into a business tax on net income;  work with the state to repeal the intangible property tax exemption and thereby restore the intangible property tax base and instituting a capital gains sales tax on the transactions of buying or selling investments, for example.  Eliminate all the tax expenditures possible which do not return a net benefit to the city.  I think the city could get sufficient funds to operate without constantly increasing our taxes.",
    "wage_gap": "Raise the wages of city employees and pass an ordinance requiring employers to pay comparable wages and then  to submit certified payrolls.  For  jobs that are the same content and responsibility, or judged to be of comparable worth, require employers to submit a fee making up the difference plus perhaps a small penalty for violating the equal pay ordinance.  The employee would be authorized to ask for the fee to be paid to her.  Or some such situation.  ",
    "waterfront_strategy": "I think the local improvement district will  work for this area and hope  the business community will stay fully vested in seeing it through.    I personally like the idea of a park with lots of green grass, picnic tables, bike and walking paths.  Trees everywhere along with landscaping which makes one feel more as though this is an extension of nature.  At this point I am not certain I would change much.  I did like the elevated park on the lid of the traffic lanes.  We have that situation in Mercer Island with the lidded I -90 and I had hoped this could have been accepted. I like 4 lanes of traffic with walk space between them, a more natural beachfront character.  A place that is more attractive to feet and bike traffic than cars. And yes, I think a municipal bank could help fund additional amenities for the park.",
    "misc": "I am driven by my values and my culture.  I believe the people of our city need a champion that will work to prevent our tax dollars from being sent to Wall Street for debt service on bonded debt.  We ship billions of dollars to Wall Street which could be used to finance needed infrastructure, such as housing, and recirculate the money within our own community to grow stronger, economically secure families with prevailing wage jobs. A publicly owned bank will generate revenue for the city without raising taxes, while at the same time dramatically increasing our financing capability to build critical infrastructure such as public housing. The bank could also serve as a depository for public funds that are simply parked in the vaults of Wall Street banks. It could also serve as a depository for all the marijuana money that floats around in brown paper bags.  "
