    This guide is based on answers candidates provided to a Seattle Times questionnaire in June. Responses were edited for space, spelling and clarity. Some candidates didn’t answer every question and some didn’t answer each question as directed. Three candidates didn’t submit any answers. We also conducted quick video interviews with leading mayoral candidates.
